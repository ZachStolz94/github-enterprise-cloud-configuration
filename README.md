<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project
Looking for a guideline to configure your GitHub Enterprise Cloud in a secure way? 

Here is a :fire: list of things to do!

<!-- ENTERPRISE ACCOUNT SECTION -->
## Enterprise account section

<!-- ORGANIZATION SECTION -->
## Organization section

<!-- REPOSITORY SECTION -->
## Repository section

<!-- GITHUB API SECTION -->
## GitHub API section
This section of the documentation is intended to get you up-and-running with real-world GitHub API applications.

[GitHub Rest API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) helps to configure many things in GitHub such as inviting/removing members, creating repositories and more.

[GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) is also available and it offers the ability to define pricisely only the required data you want in a single call. It is also very usefull to [audit GitHub logs](https://github.blog/2019-06-21-the-github-enterprise-audit-log-api-for-graphql-beginners/).

:warning: Keep note of the rate limiting in place when doing HTTP requests.

<!-- COMPLIANCY SECTION -->
## Compliancy section
No more need to worry about server deployments, updates, availability, hardening or other because with the cloud-hosted [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud#exploring-github-enterprise-cloud) because they handle this part.

* [Security trust, audit and compliancy](https://github.com/security/trust)
* [Policies](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-enterprise-cloud-addendum)
* [Incident response](https://github.com/security/incident-response)
* [Security advisory](https://github.com/advisories)
* [Bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/)




<!-- SUPPORT SECTION -->
## Support section

* [Documentations](https://help.github.com/en)
* [Request creation](https://enterprise.githubsupport.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)

Also, GitHub offers a [Premium Support](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-support/about-github-premium-support-for-github-enterprise-cloud) with a 24/7 hours of operation availability time.
